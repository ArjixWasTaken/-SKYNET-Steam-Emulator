# [SKYNET] Steam Emulator
Hello guys, I am working on a steam emulator based on the incredible Mr Goldberg emulator, the project is made in c# and is under development, I invite you to join and collaborate. The project is in an initial stage, so it is not functional yet.

When using the steam_api.dll a log file will be created in the root of the game executable with the following name "<code>[SKYNET] steam_api.log</code>"
